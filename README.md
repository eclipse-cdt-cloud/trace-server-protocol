Specification of the Trace Server Protocol

This protocol is built to decouple the backend and frontend of trace analysers, allowing traces to reside and be analysed on the backend, and visual models to be exchanged with a variety of clients.

The protocol is meant to be RESTful, over HTTP.

The specification is currently written in **OpenAPI 3.0**.

# HOW-TO

The specification should be edited with the [swagger editor](https://swagger.io/swagger-editor/) which also handles validating that the OpenAPI specification is respected.

Another option is the Swagger Viewer plug-in for VS Code.
